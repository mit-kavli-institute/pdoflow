# Add Progress Monitoring and Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

## Summary

This PR introduces comprehensive progress monitoring capabilities, enhanced testing infrastructure, and significant improvements to PDOFlow's distributed job processing system. The changes focus on providing better visibility into job execution, improving code quality, and establishing robust testing patterns.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Progress Monitoring Functions
- **`poll_posting_percent()`**: New generator function that yields completion percentages (0.0-100.0) for job postings, ideal for progress bar integration
- **`poll_job_status_count()`**: Generator for monitoring job counts by status
- **`await_for_status_threshold()`**: Blocking function that waits until job status counts meet specified conditions
- **Refactored `poll_posting()`**: Improved with NumPy-style documentation and better type hints

### 2. Job Profiling System
- 10% sampling rate for performance profiling using cProfile
- Database schema for storing profiling data (JobProfile, FunctionStat tables)
- Call graph tracking for performance analysis
- Minimal overhead design for production use

### 3. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test refactoring to remove mock usage
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis strategies
- New test modules organized by functionality:
  - `test_poll_functions.py`: Tests for all polling generators
  - `test_cluster_pool.py`: Worker pool lifecycle tests
  - `test_cluster_process.py`: Individual worker tests
  - `test_profiling.py`: Profiling system tests
  - `test_priority.py`: Priority queue tests

### 4. CLI Enhancements
- New `priority-stats` command to view priority distribution of waiting jobs
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better integration with the monitoring functions

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Aligned Black and flake8 line length to 80 characters
- Added comprehensive NumPy-style docstrings
- Improved type hints throughout
- Better separation of concerns with extracted functions

### Database Optimizations
- Fixed SQL query expressions to use `scalar_subquery()`
- Improved hybrid properties for efficient querying
- Better handling of timezone-aware datetime objects

### Testing Approach
- Removed all mock usage in favor of real components
- Database fixtures using pytest-postgresql
- Custom test workers for coverage tracking
- Hypothesis strategies for comprehensive test data generation

## Files Changed

### Core Functionality
- `src/pdoflow/cluster.py`: Added polling functions, refactored existing code
- `src/pdoflow/models.py`: Added profiling models, fixed query optimizations
- `src/pdoflow/cli.py`: Added priority-stats command

### Testing
- `tests/cluster/test_poll_functions.py`: New comprehensive tests for polling functions
- `tests/cluster/test_cluster_pool.py`: Refactored without mocks
- `tests/test_profiling.py`: New profiling system tests
- `tests/test_priority.py`: Priority queue behavior tests
- `tests/strategies.py`: Enhanced Hypothesis strategies

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md`: Development guidance and project overview
- Various analysis files for coverage and testing

## Breaking Changes

None - All changes are backward compatible. The `await_posting_completion` method in ClusterPool now delegates to a standalone function but maintains the same interface.

## Testing

- All tests pass with `tox`
- Coverage increased to 90%+
- New tests cover:
  - Edge cases (empty postings, non-existent IDs)
  - Concurrent access patterns
  - Performance profiling accuracy
  - Priority queue ordering

## Migration Notes

No migration required. New profiling tables will be created automatically if using the profiling feature.

## Checklist

- [x] Tests pass locally
- [x] Code follows project style (Black, isort, flake8)
- [x] Documentation updated with NumPy-style docstrings
- [x] No breaking changes to public APIs
- [x] Coverage maintained above 90%
- [x] Pre-commit hooks pass

## Example Usage

```python
# Monitor job completion with progress bar
from tqdm import tqdm
from pdoflow.cluster import poll_posting_percent

pbar = tqdm(total=100, desc="Processing jobs")
last_percent = 0.0
for percent in poll_posting_percent(posting_id):
    pbar.update(percent - last_percent)
    last_percent = percent
    if percent >= 100.0:
        break
    time.sleep(0.5)
pbar.close()

# Wait for specific conditions
from pdoflow.cluster import await_for_status_threshold
from pdoflow.status import JobStatus

# Wait until less than 5 jobs are executing
await_for_status_threshold(
    posting_id,
    JobStatus.executing,
    threshold_func=lambda count: count < 5
)
```
